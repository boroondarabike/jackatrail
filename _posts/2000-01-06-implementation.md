# Implementation

With most infrastructure requirements already in place, implementation would be cost-effective and timely.

-------------------------


## Road treatments

The vast majority of this route would follow existing off-road trails.

Some small on-road sections on residential streets would be necessary. This would require traffic calming and other treatments.

-------------------------


## Wayfinding

Installing new signage at key decision points would be of significant benefit to all path users.

No existing signage exists. New wayfinding infrastructure would need to be implemented.

-------------------------


## Main road crossings

There are two unsafe crossing points that are crucial to the success of this project: Belmore Road and Burke Road.

There are several options outlined in the full report. The preferred option is the installation of new signalised crossings.

-------------------------


## Bicycle parking

Areas designated for bicycle parking are inexpensive investment that have significant benefits when placed correctly.

Continuing the existing rollout by Boroondara Council along this existing route would encourage usage.

-------------------------


## Safety improvements

Some existing infrastructure along the route is unsafe or not fit for purpose.

Cheap and simple improvements can be made while making a significant different to the safety and comfort of all path users.

-------------------------


## Seats and taps

Providing seating and drinking fountains is important for all path users.

Water taps and benches should be installed to encourage path usage, particularly for elderly or disabled citizens.

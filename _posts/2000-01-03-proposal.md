# Proposal

A safe and direct bicycle route through North Balwyn and Kew East to connect to the Glass Creek Trail will link communities for both utility and recreation.

The Jacka Trail would run for 3.4 kilometres through northern Boroondara.

The Link would provide a safe and direct connection between the heart of North Balwyn and the Glass Creek Trail, which then connects to the Koonung Creek and Outer Circle Trails.

It would begin on the current path at the eastern end of the Jacka Street Reserve and run through parklands and local streets to connect with the Glass Creek Trail at Stradbroke Park in Kew East.

This would be achieved by filling in 'missing links' between existing infrastructure.

The proposal is of low cost but high potential benefit.

By improving local connectivity for both cyclists and pedestrians, significant gains in health, transport and amenity can be achieved.

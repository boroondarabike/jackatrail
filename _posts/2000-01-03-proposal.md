# Proposal

A safe and direct bicycle route through Kew East, Deepdene and Balwyn will link communities for both utility and recreation.

The Glass Creek Link would run for 3.9 kilometres through northern Boroondara.

The Link would provide a direct connection between the Koonung Creek and Anniversary Trails.

It would begin in Musca Street Reserve at run through parklands and local streets to connect with the Anniversary Trail at Whitehorse Road in Deepdene.

This would be achieved by filling in 'missing links' between existing infrastructure.

The proposal is of low cost but high potential benefit.

By improving local connectivity for both cyclists and pedestrians, significant gains in health, transport and amenity can be achieved.

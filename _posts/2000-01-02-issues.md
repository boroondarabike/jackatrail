# Issues.

#### Cycling is not currently safe or easy in Kew East, Deepdene or Balwyn

Kew East, Balwyn and Deepdene lack bicycle infrastructure that is safely separated from traffic for both pedestrians and cyclists.

-------------------------


## Safety
From 2011 to 2017, **34 cyclists were injured** in crashes throughout East Kew, Deepdene and Balwyn. Eight of these were classified as ‘serious’.

At present, there is no separated on-road infrastructure in East Kew, Deepdene or Balwyn. This is a major barrier to encouraging commuter and utility cycling.

The existing disjointed off-road paths are separated by **busy four-lane 60km/h roads** and have few crossing points. This strongly discourages school and recreational cycling

-------------------------


## Connectivity
The existing Glass Creek Trail is disjointed and does not connect well to the wider network of bicycle infrastructure.

The current path terminates in Hays Paddock in the north with **limited signage and infrastructure** to direct users onto the Koonung Creek Trail near Burke Road.

To the south, the Trail comes to an abrupt end in Stradbroke Park at the intersection of Burke and Belmore Roads.

-------------------------


## Infrastructure

Wayfinding along the current route is non-existent.

While much infrastructure is already in place, small connections between the isolated segments is required.

Both on and off-road paths require infrastructure to encourage cycling.
